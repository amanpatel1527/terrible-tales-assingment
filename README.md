# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Code functioing beloww -->

This React component creates a chart that displays the frequency of the 20 words that appear most frequently in a text file. Using the get() function, the component downloads the text file from the URL "https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt" and parses it into an array of words using the Papa.parse() function from the PapaParse package. The component then builds an object using a for loop to tally the frequency of each phrase and uses the sort() function to create an array of the 20 most frequent terms.

The chart was created using the Chart.js library, a well-liked JavaScript charting library. With the word on the X-axis and the frequency on the Y-axis, the graph is a bar chart that displays the frequency of each word. The canvas element, which may be accessed using the useRef() hook, is used to generate the chart.


The component also has a text input area where the user may insert custom text to create a chart, but this feature is not currently operational. A "Export" button on the component enables users to download the data as a CSV file using the FileSaver.js module.


You can import this component into your React application and include it in your JSX code to use it. The input field and styling can then be adjusted as necessary. You don't need to add any further functionality because the component automatically collects the data when the "Submit" button is clicked. When the data has been fetched, the chart will be automatically displayed.
