# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Code functioing beloww -->

This code creates the Apk1 React component.

The useState hook was used to initialise the component's data state variable to null. It also makes use of the useRef hook to make a reference to a canvas element.

When the "Submit" button is clicked, the asynchronous fetchData method is called. It downloads the text from terriblytinytales.com/test.txt, separates it into words, and calculates the frequency of each word's occurrence. The top 20 words are then chosen after sorting the list of word frequency counts in descending order. The generated information is kept in the state variable data of the component.

When the "Export" button is clicked, the handleExport function is invoked. It transforms the data in the data into a string using the PapaParse package.

CSV format and then downloads the file using the file-saver library. The useEffect hook is used to draw the histogram chart using the Chart.js library. It listens for changes to the data state variable and redraws the chart when it changes. The chart is drawn on the canvas element using the data in data. Finally, the component returns a button that triggers the fetchData function when clicked. If data is not null, it also renders the canvas element and a "Export" button that triggers the handleExport function when clicked.
